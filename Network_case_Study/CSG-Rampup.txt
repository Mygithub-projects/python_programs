Hands-on

Basic access & checks
 - Login to the router through VTY, Aux and Mgmt port 
 - Change the hostname 
 - Check Clock on RP and LC ; change the clock and verify if it is persistent
 - Change the password ; and check by logging back in 
 - Backup config to disk ; load config from file in disk and restore 

Checking available hardware:
 - Check the router version, OS image loaded with packages 
 - Check the LC's and which slots they are in; List the different type of LC
 - Identify different type of memory on the router 
 - File operations: copy , delete, move and using commands to check file & permissions on the router 
 - <to add>

IP connectivity:-
 - Configure Mgmt port , check for proxy arp and duplicate IP
 - Configure a static route to TFTP server, and copy config out to TFTP partition 
 - Load existing config from TFTP to router ; commit replace 
 - Explain different ping responses ; 
 - Configure mixed and plain bundles ; assign IP address and ping 

Install, Image loading : 
- Check available PIEs and images in the system 
- 

HA events :
- Perform RP FO , FB ; check time taken for RP to come up initial and NSR ready
- Check syslog for errors, tracebacks and core files 
- Perform process HA - cold and warm restart and kill 
- Perform OIR of different h/w components - LC, SPA etc. 
- Fabric test scenarions - shut/unshut 

Baseconfig bringup , and check sessions/traffic flow etc.
